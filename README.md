---About Task Management App---

Here is the application which basically based on "Task Management System".
This app is developed by using NodeJS(Runtime Environment), ExpressJS(Framework), MongoDB(Database Accessibility), Postman(For API Testing).
In this application, we can create multiple tasks and store the data into MongoDB collection.
We can fetch all the task details from the database.
We can also fetch a specific task details by its relevant Id from the database.
We can update or edit a specific task by fetching its Id and the data will be updated in the database.
Lastly, we can delete a specific task by fetching its Id which will also reflect on the database.
